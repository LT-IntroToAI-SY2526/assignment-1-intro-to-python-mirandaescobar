# Assignment 1 - Write UP
Miranda Escobar's Write UP
## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1.**What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
My intial expierence with python was that it refreshed some of my memory when coding. Prior to this, I had experience in html, and javascript whichi haven't done in over a year so I was a bit risty to it. But after using it, it became more familar and i find it a little more self-explanatory. For example, when doing a else if loop its elif instead, 

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I used AI effectively by reflecting on parts that I didn't know how to do. For example instead of asking directly for the answer, I asked for somewhere to start. If it gave me somewhere to start that i didn't know how to do, then I asked AI to clarify what it meant/ how to procede from the given solution.
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
 The concept that was most confusing was probably a1.py problem 3 which was the concept of using integers in a for loop. Ai helped e understand them by breakingdown the problem into parts then explaining the function of each part individually.
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
t I learned alot about python with collaborating with AI such as defining how to do things such as forloops and while loop syntax. The strategies that worked best for learning rather than just getting answers what the function that claude provided of highlighting a part and clicking explain with the code given. For example, if I did not know what range was so i asked claude what was the purpose of including range in my answer and it help me to clarify what it was for.
